>User defined package

- A `package` is a pack or group f classes, interfaces and other packages.
- User defined package are those package which are defined by users/programmers.
- We can make a user defined package by using `package` keyword at the of the file along with package_name.
- And use that package by using `import` keyword along with the package_name.ClassName at the top of needed file.

    Example:
        package MyPack; //Mypack:- package_name which is usually folder_name

        public class ClassName {
            ......
        }

        ----------------------
        import MyPack.ClassName;

        class DemoClass extends ClassName {
            ......
        }
