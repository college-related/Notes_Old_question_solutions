## 2b, Instruction cycle, machine cycle and T-states.

- **Instruction Cycle**
    - It is a fetch-decode-execute cycle that CPU follows from boot-up to the shut down of the computer in order to process the instrcution provided.
    - It is also the time required to complete one instrution.
- **Machine Cycle**
    - It is the time required to complete one operation or subtask of acessing memory, input, output or acknowledging external request.
    - It may consists of 3 to 6 T-states.
    - Some machine cycles are:- `Opcode fetch`, `memory read`, `I/O write cycle`, etc 
- **T-States**
    - It is the amount of time to perform one sub divison of the operation. It is also known as a unit time. Each machine cycles have to perform a set of task to complete the whole instruction, and each task will take some time to complete which is known as T-state.
    - Opcode fetch cycle have `4T-states`, Memory write cycle have `3T-states`, etc

## 3b, WAP to subtract two 16-bit numbers and store the result in memory location starting from 2075H

## 3c, Explain various assembler directives.

- Assembly language supports a number of statements that enables to control the way in which a source program assembles and lists.They are called assembler directives.
- The most comman Assembler Directives are:-
    1. **PAGE DIRECTIVE**
        - It helps to control the format of a listing of an assembled program. It is a optional Directives.
        - `Format PAGE [LENGTH],[WIDTH]` length is the maximum lines a page can have and width is the maximum characters a line can have.
        - Default values to 50,80.
    1. **TITLE DIRECTIVE**
        - It is used to define a title of the program. It is also a optional Directive.
        - `Format TITLE "TEXT"`
    1. **SEGMENT DIRECTIVE**
        - It is used to define the start of a segment.
        - A Stack segment defines stack storage, a data segment defines data items, and a code segment provides executable code.
        
                FORMAT 
                    .STACK [SIZE]
                    .DATA
                        --data to initailize
                    .CODE
                        --codes
    1. **MEMORY MODEL DIRECTIVE**
        - It is used to define how to use segments to provide space and ensure optimum execution speed.
        - `FORMAT .MODEL [MODEL NAME]`
        - The models can be `TINY, SMALL, MEDUIM, COMPACT, etc`
    1. **THE PROC DIRECTIVE**
        - The code segment contains the executable codes for a program, which consists of one or more procedures, defined initailly by `PROC Directive` and ended with `ENDP Directive`
        
                Format
                    Procedure name PROC
                            ...........
                            ...........
                    procedure name ENDP
    1. **END DIRECTIVE**
        - As mentioned above ENDP ends the procedure same as END Directive ends the whole program.
        - `FORMAT END [PROCEDURE NAME]`
    1. **THE EQU DIRECTIVE**
        - It is used to redefine symbolic names.

                Example:
                    DATAX DB 25
                    DATA EQU DATAX
    1. **THE .STARTUP and .EXIT DIRECTVE**
        - MASM 6.0 introduced the .STARTUP and .EXIT directive to simplify the initailization and termination of program.

## 4b, Write a procedure program for 8086 for new line and use it to display the three different string in different lines.

## 5a, What are various sources of interrupts. Explain interrupt vector table in 8086 MP.

- A interrupt is a emergency signal that when the microprocessor gets it stops all the further execution of instruction and service the interrupt first. A interrupt can occur in the microprocessor internally or externally.
- The sources of interrupts are as follows:-
    1. **Processor Interrupts**
        - This interrupt is caused by some error conditions produced in the processor internally during the execution of instruction.
        - Example: divide by zero, register overflow,etc
    1. **Hardware Interrupts**
        - This interrupt is caused by external signal applied to the interrupt pins.
        - In 8086 microprocessor the external interrupts are in the NMI(NON-Maskable Interrupt) pins.
        - In 8085 microprocessor the external interrupts are in the INTR(INterrupt Request) pins.
    1. **Software Interrupts**
        - This interrupt is caused by the available interrupt instructions.
        - In 8086 INT instruction and INT 21H instruction cause software interrupts.
        - In 8085 RST 0 - RST 7 instructions causes software interrupts.

## 5b, What do you mean by address decoding? Design an address decoding circuit to interface 4K*8 RAM, 8K*8 ROM and 16K*8 RAM with starting address 0000h

- Total number of address lines = 16 (A<sub>15</sub> to A<sub>0</sub>)
- Size of EPROM = **4kb * 8** = **1kb * 4 * 8** = 2<sup>10</sup> * 2<sup>2</sup> * 8 =  2<sup>12</sup> * 8  
- number of address lines required for ROM = 12 (A<sub>11</sub> to A<sub>0</sub>)
- Size of RAM  = **8kb * 8** = **1kb * 8 * 8** = 2<sup>10</sup> * 2<sup>3</sup> * 8 = 2<sup>13</sup> * 8
- number of address lines required for RAM 2 = 13 (A<sub>12</sub> to A<sub>0</sub>)

### a, Direct Memory Access Controller

- DMA (Direct Memory access) is an I/O technique commanly used for high speed data transfer. In DMA the MPU releases the control buses to a device called DMA controller.
- The DMA controller manages the data transfer between memory and peripheral devices bypassing the MPU. Simply it is a processor capabale of copying data from one location to another location in a high speed.
- Some of the comman DMAs are 8257 DMA controller, 8237 DMA controller, etc.
- 8237 is a programmable DMA controller used to transfer data from or to the system memory directly from external devices. _i.e memory to memory transfer is also possible_

### c, 8085 flag register

- Flag register is a register used in microprocessors to store the status of the current operation performed in ALU. Some status are carry status, when the operation have carry.
- 8085 microprocessor have a 8-bit register for flag in which 3 bits are don't cares and 5-bits are `5 flipflops` used to `set or reset` a flag or status.

|S|Z|x|AC|x|P|x|C|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|

`[Where x = don't cares]`

- **Sign flag(S):** It is set if the result is a negative number.
- **Zero flag(Z):** It is set if the result of an operation is 0
- **Auxllary carry flag(AC):** It is set if the 4-bit operation yeilds a carry.
- **Parity flag(P):** It is set if there is even number of 1's in the result. 
- **Carry flag(C):** It is set if the operation has a carry.
