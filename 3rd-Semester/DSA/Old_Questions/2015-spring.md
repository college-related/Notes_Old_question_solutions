## 1a

### "To write an efficient program, we should know about data structure". Explain the above statement.

## 1b

### What is ADT? Explain different primitive operations that we can perform on data structures.

## 1c

### List the applications of stack in computing as well as not computing world.

## 2a

### What is infix, prefix and postfix expression? Convert the following infix expression into postfix expression showing the content of stack in each step. P = A+(B*C-(D/E$F)*G)*H

## 2b

### Compare circular queue with linear queue. Write Enqueu and Dequeue algorithm of circular queue.

## 3a

### How dynamic list is different form static list? What are the primitive operations that we can perform in a list? Explain with suitable example.

## 3b

### What is doubly linked list (DLL) and circular Linked List (CLL)? Write an algorithm to insert a node in specified position of doubly linked list.

## 4a

### Define BST. Construct a BST using the following data U,N,I,V,E,R,S,I,T,Y,O,F,P,O,K,H,A,R,A. Also perform pre-order, in-order and post order traversal.

## 6a

### Define graph. What are the difference between traversing in graph and traversing in tree? Expain with suitable example.

## 6b

### Define Hash Collision. 66,47,87,90,126,140,145,153,177,285,393,395,467,566,620,735. From above data, store the values into hash table withh 20 positions, using division method(key%tablesize) of hashing and the linear probing and quadratic probing method for resolving collision.
