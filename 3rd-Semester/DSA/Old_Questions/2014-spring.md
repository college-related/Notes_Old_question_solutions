### Justify the statement "Data Structure is the backbone of software programming". What is ADT?

## 1b

### Explain the basic operations of stack. Write an algorithm for insertion and deletion of an element in a stack. Also mention the condition for overflow and underflow in stack.

## 2a

### What is infix,prefix and postfix expression? Convert the following infix expression into postfix epression showing the content of stack in each step.
### P = A+(B/C-(D*E$F)+G)*H

## 2b

### Compare circular queue with linear queue. Write enqueue and dequeue algorithm of circular queue.

## 3a

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of linear linked list? Show an algorithm to insert an element at the end and at specified position of the single linked list.

## 3b
