## 1a,

- **i,(B u C)** = Exactly two components are found to be in proper working order `or` at most three components are found to be defective.
- **ii,(B n C)** = Exactly two components are found to be in proper working order `and` at most three components are found to be defective.
- **iii,(A u C)** = All four components are found defective `or` at most three components are found to be defective.
- **iv,(A n C)** = All four components are found defective `or` at most three components are found to be defective. = Three components are found to be defective.

## 1b,

    We have,
        Probability male is of age 1-16 = P(A) = 0.25
        Probability male is of age 17-24 = P(B) = 0.14
        Probability male is of age 25-64 = P(C) = 0.43
        Probability male is of age 64-Over = P(D) = 0.18

        Probability male is of age 1-16 wear glasses = P(W/A) = 0.2
        Probability male is of age 17-24 wear glasses = P(W/B) = 0.1
        Probability male is of age 25-64 wear glasses = P(W/C) = 0.4
        Probability male is of age 64-Over wear glasses = P(W/D) = 0.8

        `Using Bayer's formula`

            Probability male wear glasses = P(W) = P(A).P(W/A) + P(B).P(W/B) + P(C).P(W/C) + P(D).P(W/D) = 0.38

            Probability male wearing glasses is of age 1-16 = P(A/W) = P(A).P(W/A) / P(W) = 1.131
            Probability male wearing glasses is of age 17-24 = P(B/W) = P(B).P(W/B) / P(W) = 0.0368
            Probability male wearing glasses is of age 24-64 = P(C/W) = P(C).P(W/C) / P(W) = 0.453
            Probability male wearing glasses is of age 64-Over = P(D/W) = P(D).P(W/D) / P(W) = 0.379

## 2a,

|**Number of failure**|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|**Probability**|0.18|0.28|0.25|0.18|0.06|0.04|0.01|

>i, Find the expected number of failures (i.e mean)

>ii, Find the variance of number of failures (i.e Var(X))
