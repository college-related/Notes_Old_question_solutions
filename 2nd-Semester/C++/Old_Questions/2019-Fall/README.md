>Dynamic memory allocation

- Dynamic memory allocation is the process of allocating memory space of a sturcture in the storage during the runtime.
- In simple words the size of the sturcture(like array) is determined during the runtime.
- It is used when we don't know the size of the structure we are working with before hand. For instance:- if we have to record data about students of a school every year we won't know the size of new students, so we might allocate memory dynnamically.

>How we achieve it in C++

- In C++ we allocate memory dynamically by using the `new` operator.
- *Syntax:* `new data-type;`
