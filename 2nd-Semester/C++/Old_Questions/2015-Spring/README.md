>Inheritance

- Inheritance is the feature of OOP langauge that allows to inherit data members(i.e variable and functions) of a class to another class.
- It is same as inheriting genes of parents by the child. The inherited class is called base or parent class, the inheriting class is called sub or child class.

>Advantage of Inheritance

- It makes the code reusable.
- It reduces the duplication of data members inside classes.
- We can create template classes using abstract class and inherit them when needed.
- Data hiding or abstraction can be gained using inheritance.
